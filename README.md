# Workshop_Manual-RFM-Clustering

## About the Project

* Title : Manual Customer Segmentation Using RFM Clustering for Online Retail Dataset
* Description : This project aims to segment customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) method to analyze customer behavior and identify customers who are most likely to respond to different marketing methods.
* Library : `pandas` is used for dataset manipulation, `datetime` is used for date and time manipulating dates and times, `matplotlib.pyplot` is used for making visualization, and `warnings` is used for ignoring unnecessary alert for some code.

## Getting Started
Before starting the project with your own local computer, you need to prepare a few configuration so things can be done the same.

### Prerequisites
* Note that I did the project using Jupyterlab on Anaconda Navigator. All you need to do is download the Anaconda Navigator in the link below and install it.
* [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
 
### Installation
1 First, After finish installing your Anaconda Navigator you need to install Python environment at least Python 3.9.12 or the latest version on your local. For my first time, I just followed the instruction from this content => [Install Python Environtment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs) 
2 Secondly, install all of libraries on your Jupyter Notebook by entering these commands
```sh
pip install pandas
```
```sh
pip install DateTime
```
```sh
pip install matplotlib
```
3 Next, download the dataset => [Dataset](https://github.com/aryaoctav/Workshop_Manual-RFM-Clustering/blob/main/Online%20Retail.xlsx)
4 Then, Import the dataset using pandas function for excel

## Usage
This project can be used to determine what kind of campaign, promo, or discount that suits for each type of customers.

For example, based on this result of course we want to prioritize hibernating customer to give them some kind of engagement so they wont churn in the future and hopefully still interested with our business.

## Contributing

If you have a suggestion that would make my version better, please feel free to use it on your local, making a new branch, or even forking this repository. I hope you can share your work to me and also don't forget to give the project a star! Thank you fellow learner!

Disclaimer : This project was originally a learning workshop from Tokopedia Academy. However, I already modified the code and make them my own version. So it is now an open source for anyone who wants to collaborate.
